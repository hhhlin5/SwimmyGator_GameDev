# Overview
   "Swimmy Gator" is a 2D side-scrolling game developed using a custom-built Gator engine. Players control a gator character by pressing the spacebar on the keyboard,
   navigating through an underwater environment while avoiding various obstacles. As the game progresses, the gator swims faster, making it increasingly challenging
   to avoid obstacles. The game features a timer, and the objective is to survive for as long as possible as the game speed gradually increases.<br>
